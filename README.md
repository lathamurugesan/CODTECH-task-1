TITLE:Customer segmentation using k-means algorithm

OBJECTIVE:
The objective of my customer segmentation project was to identify distinct customer groups to enhance targeted marketing and improve customer experiences. Using the K-means algorithm, I segmented the customer base into clusters based on purchasing behavior and demographics. This allows for more personalized marketing strategies, optimized resource allocation, and better product development. The insights gained will help in increasing customer retention and discovering new growth opportunities. Overall, the project aims to drive higher engagement, satisfaction, and profitability.

steps involved in the project:
Data Collection: Gather relevant customer data such as demographics, purchase history, and behavioral information.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data by handling missing values, normalizing features, and encoding categorical variables.

Feature Selection: Select the most relevant features that will be used for segmentation, ensuring they provide meaningful insights into customer behavior.

Determine Optimal Number of Clusters: Use methods like the Elbow Method or Silhouette Score to determine the optimal number of clusters (K) for segmentation.

Apply K-means Algorithm: Run the K-means algorithm on the preprocessed data to assign customers to clusters based on their feature similarities.

Evaluate and Interpret Clusters: Analyze the resulting clusters to understand their characteristics and ensure they make business sense. Validate the clusters by checking their consistency and distinctiveness.

Visualize Clusters: Use visualization techniques such as scatter plots, cluster centroids, and heatmaps to represent the clusters and their features.

Implement Insights: Apply the insights gained from the segmentation to develop targeted marketing strategies, personalized customer experiences, and optimized resource allocation.
